### 2. Act 1: The Journalist  
**Title:** Headline  
**Perspective:** The Journalist  
**Mini-Game:** Memory / Clue-Finding  
**Goal:** Collect evidence about the bridge collapse and decide what story to publish.  
**Story Summary:**  
The journalist investigates the bridge collapse and discovers a photo of a figure on the bridge the night before.  
Although there are other leads, fear from their editor pushes them to choose the most sensational one, the photo.  
That story becomes the headline, accusing someone of sabotage.  
In the canon story, this false version is what the public believes, leading to the bad ending.  
If the player finds every clue, they uncover the truth that the figure was actually an engineer trying to fix the damage in secret.  
He was ordered not to, and when caught, he did not have time to finish the repairs.  
The bridge still collapses.  

**True Clue:** Maintenance was due for weeks.  
**False Clue:** A shadowy figure seen on the bridge, suggesting sabotage.

### 3. Act 2: The Engineer  
**Title:** Silent Fix  
**Perspective:** The Engineer  
**Mini-Game:** Stealth / Time-Based Puzzle  
**Goal:** Repair the bridge before being discovered.  
**Story Summary:**  
The engineer disobeys orders to stay silent and sneaks onto the bridge at night to fix the damaged beams.  
He works in the dark, hiding from passing patrols.  
Before he can finish, he is caught and forced to leave.  
The bridge collapses hours later, and the next morning, his blurred photo spreads across the news under the headline "Sabotage Suspect Identified."  
In the canon story, this false report becomes accepted as truth.  
If the player completes the game correctly, they realize he was never trying to destroy the bridge but to save it.  

**True Clue:** The engineer was trying to fix the bridge.  
**False Clue:** He was caught and framed for damaging the bridge.

### 4. Act 3: The Supervisor  
**Title:** Orders and Silence  
**Perspective:** The Supervisor  
**Mini-Game:** Decision / Management  
**Goal:** Balance orders, safety, and limited resources while deciding whether to send the engineer back to the bridge.  
**Story Summary:**  
The supervisor oversees the maintenance team and knows the bridge’s condition is worsening.  
They are aware that repairs are overdue but are pressured by higher officials to delay work until further notice.  
They tell the engineer not to fix the bridge, hoping to keep him safe and avoid conflict with the mayor’s office.  
In the canon story, this decision leads to disaster when the engineer goes against orders and is caught.  
Rumors spread that the supervisor was part of the sabotage, though the truth is that they were simply trying to protect their worker in a system that gave them no power.  

**True Clue:** The supervisor was looking out for the engineer, as resources and manpower were scarce.  
**False Clue:** The supervisor was involved in sabotaging the bridge.

### 5. Act 4: The Mayor  
**Title:** Behind Closed Doors  
**Perspective:** The Mayor  
**Mini-Game:** Decision / Strategy  
**Goal:** Manage the city and cover up the disaster while maintaining public image.  
**Story Summary:**  
The mayor learns about the bridge’s structural issues and the engineer’s attempts to fix it.  
To protect the city’s reputation and political position, the mayor orders that the engineer be prevented from intervening and lets misinformation about sabotage spread.  
In the canon story, the public believes the sabotage narrative, and the disaster is blamed on the engineer or unknown forces.  
If the player uncovers all clues throughout the acts, they understand the mayor’s orders were motivated by corruption and fear, not genuine concern for safety, and the engineer’s actions were heroic.  

**True Clue:** The mayor wanted to maintain political image and hid the real reason for the collapse.  
**False Clue:** The mayor orchestrated the bridge sabotage deliberately.
