## Website Overview
**Fractured Night** is an interactive website that shows the events of a bridge collapse through different perspectives.  
Players explore the event as four people: a journalist, an engineer, a supervisor, and a mayor.  
Each act presents clues and mini-games that reveal how each person acted, and what is known.  

The public story may be different from the real story, so players must find the clues to the truth.  
Hidden or true clues are found by winning games, which hold the ability to piece together the real story.
The goal is to show how different perspectives and partial information can change how people understand events.

> Can you find the full story or only the version that people believe?

## Website Outline

---

### 1. Home / The Beginning
- Title screen with “Start” button
- Description of the website
- Short introduction explaining that a bridge collapsed in the city  
- Navigation bar (also applies for all pages): **Home | Act 1 | Act 2 | Act 3 | Act 4 | About Us**  
- The home page sets up the event and explains that players can explore different viewpoints  
- Players learn that the public story may not be the full story

### Public Story Summary
The bridge collapses one night. A journalist discovers a photo of a shadowy figure on the bridge and reports it.  
The journalist also finds a written memo of the supervisor telling the engineer not to fix the bridge and reports it.
The report and the mayor blames the engineer and supervisor, saying they were in conflict with the mayor.  
The mayor says the sabotage was a stunt to send a message, but he himself is innocent because he provided maintenance checks.  
The public praises the mayor for acting responsibly, and the engineer and supervisor are arrested.  

> The website lets players explore each character’s perspective to understand how the official story is formed from partial information.
> Finding hidden or true clues do not change the events of the story, but influences how the player interprets it.
> Not finding hidden clues lead to an incomplete retelling of events.

### 2. Act 1: The Journalist
**Title:** Headline  
**Perspective:** The Journalist  
**Mini-Game:** Spot the Detail / Memory Matching

**What the Public Believe:**  
The journalist looks for information that could help solve the case.
The journalist finds a shadowy photo of someone on the bridge the night before.  
The journalist also discovers the written memo and reports the evidence to be published.
The story published claims sabotage and names the engineer and supervisor as responsible.  

> Players can explore the evidence to see how one piece of information can shape public opinion.

**Incomplete Clue:** The shadow figure on the bridge was sabotaging it, and the memo makes the engineer and supervisor guilty.

**Hidden Clue:** The journalist found one last piece of information aside from the incriminating evidence. 
They find photos of the bridge looking weak. However, they deemed it not newsworthy, as a potential saboteur is much more exciting than a more probable faulty bridge.

### True Story Summary
The journalist found much more than the shadow photo. They find photos of the bridge looking weak. The engineer was actually trying to fix the bridge. The supervisor was just looking out for the engineer's safety. The mayor actually restricted maintenance. The evidence was unfortunate enough to look like a sabotage, but the truth was not spread. Only lies and incomplete truths flooded the news.

> Players may find the true story by winning all the games, or may get stuck and piece out an incomplete ending.

### 8. Details
We will use HTML forms for a final question sequence for the user to answer, and being explained the story they collected, in addition to what would have happened if the story they found was brought out to the public. 
One webpage will collect text data from the user, as they answer questions of the story. They get the text or code if they beat the game from the act. Another webpage will explain the story based on your answers and what that could cause if the public knew.
One last webpage will show your accuracy or score based on what you answered in the form.
