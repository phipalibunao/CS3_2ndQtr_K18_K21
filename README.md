# Fractured Night üåö

## Website Overview
**Fractured Night** is an interactive website that tells the story of a bridge collapse from four different points of view.  
The website allows players to explore the event through the perspectives of a journalist, an engineer, a supervisor, and a mayor.  
Each act shows part of the story and provides mini-games and clues that players must use to understand what really happened.  
Some clues are true and some are false, so players must pay attention to find the correct story.  
The goal is to let players see how people can misunderstand events when they only see part of the information.  

> Will you find the real story or only fragments of it?

### Story Summary
The bridge collapses during the night. A journalist sees someone on the bridge before the collapse and reports it as sabotage.  
The mayor blames the engineer and the supervisor, saying they ignored orders and failed to maintain the bridge.  
The public praises the mayor for taking action, and the engineer and supervisor are arrested.  
If players explore all acts and find every clue, they learn the real story: the engineer was trying to fix the bridge, the supervisor was protecting him, and the mayor covered up the cause to protect his image.
