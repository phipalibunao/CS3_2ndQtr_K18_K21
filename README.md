### 2. Act 1: The Journalist  
**Title:** Headline  
**Perspective:** The Journalist  
**Mini-Game:** Memory / Clue-Finding  
**Goal:** Collect evidence about the bridge collapse and decide what story to publish.  
**Story Summary:**  
The journalist investigates the bridge collapse and discovers a photo of a figure on the bridge the night before.  
Although there are other leads, fear from their editor pushes them to choose the most sensational one, the photo.  
That story becomes the headline, accusing someone of sabotage.  
In the canon story, this false version is what the public believes, leading to the bad ending.  
If the player finds every clue, they uncover the truth that the figure was actually an engineer trying to fix the damage in secret.  
He was ordered not to, and when caught, he did not have time to finish the repairs.  
The bridge still collapses.  

**True Clue:** Maintenance was due for weeks.  
**False Clue:** A shadowy figure seen on the bridge, suggesting sabotage.

### 3. Act 2: The Engineer  
**Title:** Silent Fix  
**Perspective:** The Engineer  
**Mini-Game:** Stealth / Time-Based Puzzle  
**Goal:** Repair the bridge before being discovered.  
**Story Summary:**  
The engineer disobeys orders to stay silent and sneaks onto the bridge at night to fix the damaged beams.  
He works in the dark, hiding from passing patrols.  
Before he can finish, he is caught and forced to leave.  
The bridge collapses hours later, and the next morning, his blurred photo spreads across the news under the headline "Sabotage Suspect Identified."  
In the canon story, this false report becomes accepted as truth.  
If the player completes the game correctly, they realize he was never trying to destroy the bridge but to save it.  

**True Clue:** The engineer was trying to fix the bridge.  
**False Clue:** He was caught and framed for damaging the bridge.
