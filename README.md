## Website Overview
**Fractured Night** is an interactive website that shows the events of a bridge collapse through different perspectives.  
Players explore the event as four people: a journalist, an engineer, a supervisor, and a mayor.  
Each act presents clues and mini-games that reveal how each person acted before the incident, and what is known.  
The public story may be different from the real story, so players must find the clues to the truth.  
Hidden clues are found by winning games, which piece together the real story.
The goal is to show how different perspectives and partial information can change how people understand events.
