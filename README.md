## Website Overview
**Fractured Night** is an interactive website that shows the events of a bridge collapse through different perspectives.  
Players explore the event as four people: a journalist, an engineer, a supervisor, and a mayor.  
Each act presents clues and mini-games that reveal what each person knows or thinks happened.  
The public story may be different from the real story, so players must decide which clues to trust.  
The goal is to show how different perspectives and partial information can change how people understand events.

> Can you find the full story or only the version that people believe?
