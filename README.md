## Website Overview
**Fractured Night** is an interactive website that shows the events of a bridge collapse through different perspectives.  
Players explore the event as four people: a journalist, an engineer, a supervisor, and a mayor.  
Each act presents clues and mini-games that reveal how each person acted, and what is known.  

The public story may be different from the real story, so players must find the clues to the truth.  
Hidden or true clues are found by winning games, which hold the ability to piece together the real story.
The goal is to show how different perspectives and partial information can change how people understand events.

> Can you find the full story or only the version that people believe?

### Public Story Summary
The bridge collapses one night. A journalist discovers a photo of a shadowy figure on the bridge and reports it.  
The journalist also finds a written memo of the supervisor telling the engineer not to fix the bridge and reports it.
The report and the mayor blames the engineer and supervisor, saying they were in conflict with the mayor.  
The mayor says the sabotage was a stunt to send a message, but he himself is innocent because he provided maintenance checks.  
The public praises the mayor for acting responsibly, and the engineer and supervisor are arrested.  

> The website lets players explore each character’s perspective to understand how the official story is formed from partial information.
> Finding hidden or true clues do not change the events of the story, but influences how the player interprets it.
> Not finding hidden clues lead to an incomplete retelling of events.

### 2. Act 1: The Journalist
**Title:** Headline  
**Perspective:** The Journalist  
**Mini-Game:** Spot the Detail / Memory Matching  
**Goal:** Collect evidence and decide what to report.  

**What the Public Believe:**  
The journalist looks for information that could help solve the case.
The journalist finds a shadowy photo of someone on the bridge the night before.  
The journalist also discovers the written memo and reports the evidence to be published.
The story published claims sabotage and names the engineer and supervisor as responsible.  

> Players can explore the evidence to see how one piece of information can shape public opinion.

**Incomplete Clue:** The shadow figure on the bridge was sabotaging it, and the memo makes the engineer and supervisor guilty.

**Hidden Clue:** The journalist found one last piece of information aside from the incriminating evidence. 
They find photos of the bridge looking weak. However, they deemed it not newsworthy, as a potential saboteur is much more exciting than a more probable faulty bridge.

### 3. Act 2: The Engineer
**Title:** Silent Night  
**Perspective:** The Engineer  
**Mini-Game:** Wires  
**Goal:** Remove and rearrange different wires.

**What the Public Believe:**

They go to the bridge to instead try to make it worse.
The engineer is seen on the bridge.
They are forced to leave the bridge, and the next day, their blurred photo appears in news reports suggesting sabotage.  
The engineer is accused of tampering with the bridge.  
The engineer is arrested.

> Players completing the mini-game can see how partial information creates a false impression.  

**Mini-Game Details:**  
Players reconnect wires or fix bridge sections to see how actions are interpreted differently.  

**False Clue:** The engineer reads about the memo and ignores it. They intentionally damaged the bridge.

**True Clue:** The engineer reads about the memo and ignores it. They try to restore the bridge, but they were framed of doing the opposite.
The engineer knows something is wrong with the bridge.

### 4. Act 3: The Supervisor
**Title:** Orders and Conflict  
**Perspective:** The Supervisor  
**Mini-Game:** Scheduling / Organizing  
**Goal:** Balance instructions and safety with limited resources and time.  

**What the Public Believe:**  
The supervisor tells the engineer not to fix the bridge, with a motive to go against the mayor.  
The public believes this shows negligence or sabotage.
Evidence suggest the supervisor was involved in the collapse.
The supervisor gets arrested.

> Players can see how following instructions can be misinterpreted when only part of the story is reported.  

**Mini-Game Details:**  
Players are given a calendar with different people and resources to be placed on a day. Players have to arrange them according to the criteria.

**False Clue:** The supervisor tried to cause the bridge to collapse.

**True Clue:** The supervisor kept the engineer safe because they have low resources and people (shown with the mini-game).

Math problems. Place budgets on different topics according to what is asked.

**False Clue:** The mayor did maintenance and managed the budget.

**True Clue:** The mayor cut the budget for reputation, other projects, and himself.

### True Story Summary
The journalist found much more than the shadow photo. They find photos of the bridge looking weak. The engineer was actually trying to fix the bridge. The supervisor was just looking out for the engineer's safety. The mayor actually restricted maintenance. The evidence was unfortunate enough to look like a sabotage, but the truth was not spread. Only lies and incomplete truths flooded the news.

> Players may find the true story by winning all the games, or may get stuck and piece out an incomplete ending.
